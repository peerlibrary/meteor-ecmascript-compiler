ecmascript-compiler smart package
=================================

A fork for the official [Meteor ecmascript smart package](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/tree/devel/packages/ecmascript),
but just a compiler without runtime dependencies, and no React and modules support. It provides the functionality of the
package to one before Meteor 1.3 (and introduction of modules support in Meteor). Used for legacy reasons and backwards
compatibility.

Server side only.

Installation
------------

```
meteor add peerlibrary:ecmascript-compiler
```
